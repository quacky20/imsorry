        <h2>I KNOW THAT SAYING THIS DOES NOT MAKE IT ANY BETTER BUT,</h2>
        <p>
            I have been reflecting on our arguments and how I behave during them. I realize that I always let my anger get the best of me. I always say things that are hurtful and damaging, and I deeply regret my words and actions. I am truly sorry for the pain I caused, because you deserve to be treated with respect and kindness and I failed to do that. <br><br>
            I have realized that my anger was a reaction to my own sadness and frustration, but that is no excuse for the way I spoke to you. I should have managed my emotions better. I understand that saying sorry doesn't undo the harm.<br><br>
            I want to be completely honest with you: I am not just apologizing to offer empty words, but to show you that I am committed to making real changes. I recognize that saying sorry alone isn't enough. It's through my actions that I need to prove that I am working to manage my emotions better and to communicate more thoughtfully.<br><br>
            I value our relationship immensely, and I want to do everything I can to make things right. I am actively working on strategies to address my anger and to handle conflicts in a more constructive way. This involves self-reflection, seeking resources, and finding healthy outlets for my emotions.
